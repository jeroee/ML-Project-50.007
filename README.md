# ML-Project-50.007

## Requirements 

The list of dependencies used that are not from Python's standard library are **numpy, pandas, tqdm** 

```
pip install tqdm numpy pandas 
```

## Run Time 

The run time for each of the parts is approximately 30 seconds for each part as the code utilises matrix computation to increase the efficiency of the Viterbi Algorithm. 

## Usage 

### Part 2: Finding the Emission Parameters

```
python3 /part2.py
```

The file gives 3 outputs for EN, SG and CN to **EN/dev_p2.pred**, **CN/dev_p2.pred**, **SG/dev_p2.pred**

### Part 3: Viterbi Algorithm and Transition Parameters 

```
python3 /part3.py
```

This file gives 3 outputs for EN, SG and CN to **EN/dev_p2.pred**, **CN/dev_p2.pred**, **SG/dev_p2.pred**

### Part 4: Third Best Viterbi Algorithm

```
python3 /part4.py 
```

The file gives 1 output, **EN/dev_p4.pred**

### Part 5: Design Challenge  

Do open the file part5final.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook. The file generates quantifiable outputs regarding the system's performance. It uses a Recurrent Neural Network.
